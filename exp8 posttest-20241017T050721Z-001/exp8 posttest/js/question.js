  {
    q:'What is the primary difference between a `while` loop and a `do-while` loop?',
    options:['The `do-while` loop executes at least once, while a `while` loop may not execute at all if the condition is false', 'The `while` loop is faster than the `do-while` loop', 'The `do-while` loop can only have one statement', 'There is no difference; they are the same'],

    q:'Can a `do-while` loop be used to create an infinite loop?',
    options:['Yes, if the condition is always true', 'No, it will always terminate', 'Yes, but only with a `break` statement', 'No, it cannot be used for infinite loops'],
    answer:0

    q:'What happens if the condition in a `do-while` loop is missing?',
    options:['The loop will not execute', 'Compilation error', 'The loop will run infinitely', 'Only the first iteration will run'],
